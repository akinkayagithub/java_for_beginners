04 - Escape Sequences

• Java provides special codes, called escape sequences
• They can be used to insert certain spacing and characters in the texts

We will learn below Escape sequences (there are more)
\n 		-> moves cursor to a new line
\t 		-> inserts a tab (space)
\" 		-> inserts a double quotation (")
\\ 		-> inserts a backward slash (\)

PRACTICE:
	Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming 
language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. 

	It is a general\purpose programming language intended to let 
programmers write once, run anywhere "WORA", meaning that compiled Java 
code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need to 
recompile.
