03 - Documentation with comments

-The comments may be single- line, multi-line, and documentation comments
-The comments are optional and Java compiler ignores them during execution of the program

• Single-line Comment: It starts with a pair of forwarding slash 
	Example:
	//This is a single-line comment

• Multi-line Comment: It starts with a /* and ends with */. We write comments between these two symbols
	Example:
 	/*
 		This is an example of 
		multi-line comment
	*/ 

• Documentation Comment: It starts with the delimiter (/**) and ends with */
	Example:
 	/**
 	* This is an example of documentation comment
 	*/
